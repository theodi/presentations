        There is an art exhibit around our office. We see here the Vending Machine, which scans the BBC News RSS feed
        for any of a whole list of terms related to the recession, and when it gets a hit it dispenses crisps. We are
        all quite attached to the machine.

        This is not just about Open Data, it's about the philosophy of Open Culture.

            Does everybody understand what we mean by Version Control? For those of you who don't, Version Control is a
            bit like Google Documents, in that it retains past versions of our code, and also allows us to collaborate
            very easily.

            Git is our current Weapon Of Choice - in previous tools like Subversion, operations such as branching and
            merging were extremely expensive and painful. With Git, these things become a positive pleasure.

            So Jenkins has told us that the code is good to go, so we need to get it out into the wild. In the bad
            old days, we would own a bunch of actual servers, which we'd have to look after and care for over a long
            period of time, and deploy to them probably by hand, which is error-prone and unpleasant. This is the
            classic Snowflake anti-pattern. Not any more. Now we have ephemeral cloud servers, and deployment is in the
            hands of the Chef robots.

            deploy to production many, many times per day without ever thinking about it. As soon as the PR is merged,
            the robots take over.

            We also have a completely open IRC channel. This is where we work (because we're often a distibuted team)
            but this is open to anybody. Here you can see two people who don't actually work at the ODI having a
            discussion that's only tangentially-related to ODI stuff.

            We also have a robot in the IRC channel, who can remind us when stand-ups are happening, describe things
            that have happened in Github, and show us pictures of Admiral Ackbar. He will do more in the future.

        ... being Open By Default is exhilarating. But I suspect
        that streaking at a cricket match is exhilarating, too.
        And sometimes it does feel like we're running around naked...
