    Consider the world of Open Data, where we have a load of data, but very little collaboration. If
    I use your dataset and find an error, the only way to get it fixed is to tell you about it, and hope you 
    sort it out. Compared to the open source world, this is a pre-sourceforge level of collaboration. We can 
    do better.

    Git and GitHub. How github has revolutionised the process of contributing to OSS projects.
    If you have some code, I can fork it, make my own changes, then hit a single button to merge those
    changes back upstream. This makes contribution incredibly simple, so that the admin overhead of doing
    this becomes almost zero. This allows projects to draw on a wider pool of contributors than otherwise
    would have been available.

    Github use a collaboration process they call 'Github Flow' (not to be confused with 'Git flow', which is
    more complex).
    Wouldn't it be great if we could do this with open data?
    This often gets referred to as 'git for data', though in my view git is unimportant. It's all about flow.
    Github's revolution was not that they used git - it's that they built powerful, simple workflow tools on
    top of it.

<section id="tools">
  <aside class="notes">
    This is not a new idea; people have been talking about it for years. Only problem is there are a few
    problems when it comes to handling data in git, and other systems designed for source code. Various
    projects out there looking at building replacements that handle data better, like Dat and R&amp;Wbase.
    I think we can get further with existing tools, however. If we can bend git to our will, and use it to work
    with simple data in useful ways, then we can get this revolution started early.

<section id="git-is-line-oriented">
  <aside class="notes">
    So we know what we're up against, let's look at some problems with git when working with things like CSVs.
    First, it's line-oriented, built for source code. This is OK when adding a row, or changing a few cells,
    but add a column and suddenly you have a change on every line.
    Let's look at a bit of test data. This is a small CSV file, and I've made some changes. First thing that you can
    see is that I've obviously added a column. However, it's hard to see if anything else has changed, because the diff is
    utterly useless.

<section id="git-cli">
  <aside class="notes">
    There are some things we can improve here though. First thing to realise is that we don't really care what git does
    internally; how it stores our changes, and so on. As long as we can see what's going on, git can do what it wants inside.
    That means that this is a tooling problem, so we can tinker with the tooling around the edges to try to fix our problems.
    Let's start with the git tool that *everyone* has; the command line.

    This is all very well, but what makes github flow really usable is... github. How can we get CSV diffs
    into Github? Unfortunately, their core display code isn't open source, but we have the next best thing: Gitlab.

    So, all we need to do is change the views for files and diffs to add CSV support. Files are pretty easy, but CSV is harder,
    mainly because just working out the diffs is non-trivial. Coopyhx to the rescue.
