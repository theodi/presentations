Presentations
=============

To view the presentations go to [http://theodi.github.io/presentations](http://theodi.github.io/presentations).

Presentations based on [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/).

### Structure

1. Put actual presentation in top level
2. Images and resources in folder with meaningful name
3. Link to presentation in `index.html`
4. Sorted by year and month

### Using Jekyll

You can now use a shared layout if you include the Jekyll front matter in your presentation. See blank-deck-using-jekyll-layout.html for a sample.

To preview locally:

```
bundle
jekyll serve --watch
```

Then visit http://localhost:4000 for a preview.
