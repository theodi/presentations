	<aside class="notes">There is often confusion about the relationship between big data, open data, and personal data. This slide helps clarify the following points: all three topics are related but only partially overlap. For example, if we look at all the data sets that could be classified as big data, only some of them will have an open license. Similarly, if we think about the intersection of open and personal data, most of the personal data will not be available under an open license. To be really clear about this, I could choose to publish some of my personal data under an open license, but this will probably always be the exception. To restate that in simple terms, most open data will not be personal, and most personal data will not be open. Similarly, most big data will not be personal, and most personal data will not be big. However, over time there will likely be more and more personal data sets that are so big they justify the label of big data, for example, there is a trend known as the quantified self, where people increasingly capture data about themselves and their lives. If some of these big and personal data sets were published under an open license then they would occupy this central area of the Venn diagram.</aside>
